Despite their larger size, they are easy to swallow and work wonderfully for gut health, keeping my bowels regular with every dose. I've purchased multiple bottles of Dr. Formulated Probiotics and confidently recommend them to many of my patients. The price is quite reasonable for the quality provided. I do not have any side effects from them, and I am very sensitive to a lot of things.  In terms of immune health, I rarely get sick, which I attribute, at least in part, to the effectiveness of these probiotics. For vaginal health, I have experienced no issues whatsoever, indicating that they are doing their job. Additionally, I love that this product doesn’t require refrigeration, making it incredibly convenient. The bottle is also sealed with a tamper-proof seal, and the expiration date typically extends for over a year, ensuring freshness. Overall, I recommend these probiotics.",26

7,B00Y8MP4G6,2025-10-09,Amazon,"Garden of Life Once Daily Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Women 50 Billion CFU 16 Probiotic Strains with Organic Prebiotics for Digestive, Vaginal & Immune Health, Dairy Free, Shelf Stable 30 Capsules",5.0,"I’ve been using the Garden of Life Once Daily Probiotics for Women for about five months now, and I can honestly say it’s made a real difference. I originally picked it because it has multiple strains, especially Lactobacillus reuteri, which I was already familiar with from my homemade yogurt (I ferment it for 36 hours). This supplement felt like the perfect way to add extra support.  What surprised me is how much it’s helped with things I didn’t even expect—like PMS symptoms and joint pain. My monthly cramps and mood swings have calmed down a lot, and my joints feel less stiff and achy, even after workouts or long days. I’ve also noticed I sleep better and recover faster after exercise, which I was really hoping for with L. reuteri.  For vaginal support, this probiotic includes good strains like Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. reuteri, and L. acidophilus that help balance things out and prevent infections. The organic prebiotics in it also help the good bacteria grow. Since I started taking it, I haven’t had any problems with odor, discharge, or infections. I know everyone’s different and some might prefer other strains like L. crispatus or L. jensenii, but this probiotic has been reliable for me. It’s definitely worth trying if you want something that actually helps—just listen to how your body feels.  On top of that, I try to eat foods that support vaginal health, like yogurt, and other fermented foods for probiotics, plus prebiotic-rich foods like garlic, onions, and bananas to feed the good bacteria. Healthy fats from avocados, nuts, and seeds, along with plenty of veggies and fruits, also help keep things balanced.  It’s super convenient too—no need to refrigerate, and it’s dairy-free, which is great for me. Overall, this isn’t just a trendy health product that sounds good; it’s simple, clean, and really works. If you want support for digestion, immune health, vaginal health, and overall balance, this is definitely worth a try.",102

Bonus Perks:  Dairy-Free & Shelf-Stable: No fridge? No problem. Take it on the go, to work, or on your “I’m finally taking a vacation” trip.

9,B00Y8MP4G6,2025-10-09,Amazon,"Garden of Life Once Daily Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Women 50 Billion CFU 16 Probiotic Strains with Organic Prebiotics for Digestive, Vaginal & Immune Health, Dairy Free, Shelf Stable 30 Capsules",5.0,"It does exactly what it says. I researched what, when, where, how, why, and if I should I take Probiotics. I found that the minimum requirements for effectiveness is 50 billion and a minimum of 11 strains. A lot of products claim to meet those two guidelines. But when you look at the ingredients they have a list of stuff that has nothing to do do with Probiotics bottom line. A lot of scams out there with products claiming to be the real thing but they are full of herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients that are known only to them. If you want all those ingredients buy over the counter vitamins, which might be a lot cheaper. But you and me are looking at Probiotics for a reason. Remember to stay focused on that particular reason.  I carefully compiled a list of over 125 products. Some had a few details on the ingredients and some had none. Yet, they all claimed to be Probiotics, which I quickly found out that it was not true. Anyway, if a particular product did not clearly list the required ingredients, I crossed it out from the list. Every product claims to be the best on the market. Don't fall for it. One product at the time was scratched from the list, until I found the right one for me and my medical issues.  I decided to buy Garden if Life Probiotic. I made this choice after pouring many hours on research, which needed to meet specific criteria: 50 billion and 16 strains. Anything less than 50 billion isn't that effective for reaching my medical goals (see them listed somewhere else in this post). And of course, every ingredient that is contained in this product is clearly listed on the Amazon website. My doctor said that there was a lot of research on Probiotic products on neuroscience journals and how Probiotics could help me with my particular medical conditions, which the medical field had nothing else to to offer me. As a professional researcher, I had to get my hands, right away, on high quality journals on line. I read more than 15 articles from different journals. It took me a long time (over 2 weeks) because my cognitive difficulties (remembering, understanding, etc.). The research was well designed, the findings were consistent and they were well supported. If you feel the urgency to read research just go to Google and search for ""Probiotics research on neuroscience journals."" From there you get to pick and choose from a huge selection of journals. It's like a huge salad bar, with enough variety to satisfy anyone with an enormous hunger for information. It just doesn't get any better than that.  Note: Insurance companies do not cover this product. It really is a disappointment but not enough to discourage me give up on my search for a light at the end of the tunnel.  Next is affordability. Since my goal is to consistently take it every day for many years to come, I needed to to make sure it was affordable. This product is a winner!!! Since I'm on a fixed income, I need to make sure that I wouldn't go broke in the process of trying to reconnect with my cognitive abilities and, maybe even restore some of my memories. If nothing else, based on the research, I truly believe that I'll be able to improve my cognitive skills and keep new memories. And that, ladies and gentlemen, IS THE BOTTOM LINE. The simple FACT is that I have been taking this product for just a few days and I can SEE SOME ENCOURAGING RESULTS. I wrote this post (a) without any hand written notes on the side to rely on, (b) without taking me for ever, and (c) without sweeting bullets connected with the frustration of not having a clue whether I was making any sense. Let me give you an example of how I feel right now. This is, indeed, like you are watching the Super Bowl game and your team is getting its asses kicked, badly (my doctors lack of resources to help me). You almost lose hope (will I loose my mind completely? how soon? What will happen to me when I can no longer think nor remember simple words or conversations with my loved ones?), but you don't give up. You heart is full of faith thinking that something can be done to win the game. As hard as it is, and with very little hope someone makes the perfect play (my doctor studying Probiotics for years and recently recommending to patients who had similar problems like mine. According to my doctor he was getting encouraging results) and you come back from the brinck of despair. The last day of the season, on the last second you find yourself being a part of of the winning team. You feel like you were present in the stadium with your team players when you won the Super Bowl (my the help of Probiotics). And you feel like life is returning to you and your steps are lighter, quicker, easier, and you have all the confidence of the world. Life seems to be returning to your mind and the future looks full of new possibilities and new adventures. I CAN THINK, ENGAGE IN SIMPLE CONVERSATIONS WITHOUT GETTING LOST, AND THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING. I have faith that I am going to to have a great future. A future without fear. Please you all wish me good luck, and if you don't mind praying for a stranger pray that my new found hope on Probiotics really works. Thank you for reading this long, mushy, and even corney post, but I am too excited. I just couldn't wait to share with the world. I hope others too can find new hope with this product. Nothing is guaranteed in this life. Not even Probiotics. It is just my own experience and nothing else. P. S. I'm not being paid for my comments nor was asked to write this post.",11

This once-daily probiotic has 50 billion CFU and 16 diverse strains, targeting not just digestive health but also vaginal and immune support. I really like that it includes organic prebiotics, I'm really picky about ingredients and this passes my inspection - no fillers! It's dairy-free and can be left on the shelf makes it super convenient—no refrigeration hassle, and easy to toss into a travel bag. The capsules are smooth and easy to swallow, and I’ve noticed improvements in regularity, bloating, and overall comfort. The only thing to keep in mind is that the potency is strong, so if you’re new to probiotics, you might want to start with a lower dose and build up.  Tip: Take it after your breakfast (or your first meal) for best absorption and consistency. I get nausea if I take on an empty stomach.  I highly recommend this supplement & I hope you this review is helpful 👍🏻",5

For some reason, I thought it wouldn't have any real effect and that it would be like taking a placebo. Well, no, I was completely wrong. After reading what other products offered and the reviews, I decided to buy this one. I recommend it 100%. From the first day I started taking it, I started going to the bathroom normally, without pain, without problems. I've had less gas, less constipation, and much more energy. The pills are easy to swallow, have no particular taste, and haven't caused my stomach to be upset. I've taken them early in the day and late at night, and they have the same effect.",2

I wasn’t entirely consistent at first—there were weeks I skipped—but I recently finished the bottle and figured it was a good time to share my thoughts. What I liked right away was how convenient it is. The capsules are shelf-stable, dairy-free, and don’t need to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to include in my morning routine. After about a week of consistent use, I started noticing a positive change—my digestion felt more regular and less bloated overall. Most importantly, it helped establish a more consistent bathroom schedule, which was a big win for me.  One thing I wanted to mention: before buying, I saw some reviews mentioning mild bloating or gas during the adjustment period. I didn’t experience that initially, but after a few weeks I did notice that drinking milk sometimes caused a bit of odd intestinal movement—like a noticeable rumbling or gurgling. It wasn’t painful or uncomfortable enough to be a problem, and I never had diarrhea, but it was new for me. After looking into it, it seems changes in gut flora can affect how your body reacts to foods you’re used to. Nothing serious, just something worth knowing if you experience a similar shift.",4

The 50 billion CFUs and 16 probiotic strains seemed like the perfect solution for maintaining my digestive and vaginal health. Its convenience as a once-daily capsule and its scientifically-backed formula were hard to beat. Garden of Life consistently provided me with reliable digestive support and contributed positively to my overall well-being.  However, curiosity led me to explore new options, and that's when Seraphina caught my attention. With its unique 2-in-1 approach, combining Vaginal Probiotics with Hormone Balance, Seraphina promised not just digestive health but also a comprehensive support system for women. Intrigued by its broader benefits, I decided to make the switch, hoping it might complement my current regimen. To my surprise, Seraphina completely exceeded my expectations.  From the start, I noticed a difference. While my digestion was smoother, it was the additional benefits that truly impressed me. Seraphina’s formula, with 10 billion CFU across 6 targeted strains, seemed to address my hormonal fluctuations in a way Garden of Life did not. PMS symptoms, such as bloating and mood swings, significantly diminished. The cranberry extract and other natural ingredients in Seraphina’s blend provided the extra support my urinary tract needed, reducing the occasional discomfort I had previously experienced. I order my Seraphina here",139

By flushing out old waste, you can replenish your energy with a fresh new level. It's a vital cycle for health. It's a bit pricey, but the quality is so good I couldn't resist.

It is now February 21st and I have noticed a big difference in my overall well-being.  I have always had a problem with extreme fatigue throughout the day and sleeping a lot more than what is viewed as normal. Ever since I’ve been taking these I have been going to sleep and waking up early and actually feeling well rested. I am no longer tired throughout the day. My daily mood has changed as well. I feel a lot better mentally. Maybe it has nothing to do with these probiotics, but I haven’t made any other changes in my day to day.  I’m also very easily bruised (especially because I work in a warehouse) and I haven’t had any bruises at all in the past month, which is insane for me. I used to take iron pills because I thought that was what was causing me to bruise so easily but it never helped.  Another thing I noticed is that my period cramps (and other symptoms) haven’t been as bad. I have had two periods since I started taking these and I usually suffer from TERRIBLE cramps and fatigue, but these two times I was fine.  When I started noticing these changes I was researching the symptoms of bad intestinal health and it seems as though that may have been why I was feeling so fatigued all the time. These have definitely improved my day to day life though.  Update (March 7):  I wanted to add my recent experience with a cold. Everyone in my house got sick starting about a week and a half ago and I’m usually one of the first to get hit by a cold. I have a pretty weak immune system. BUT I only got a little bit of a sore throat for half a day and then I was completely fine. That was two days ago. This is completely abnormal for me. I always get the worst symptoms compared to everyone else. My roommates are still experiencing cold symptoms like runny nose and a little bit of a cough. If you have a weak immune system, I would suggest trying these!",1

Please note: Doc did not recommend this brand, I did my own extensive research and went with this brand. I like that they are light and extremely easy to swallow however, I prefer to empty the contents over swallowing the pill. With that said, the first 3/4 of my last bottle was good but the last 15ish pills were all clumped up when I tried to empty the contents. This leads me to wonder if all the pills I didnt empty were clumped and not in its powdery form and why are they clumped..AND does itnhave the same affect clumped and hard opposed to powder.

I was so bloated, gassy and stopped up that I looked 6 month pregnant. I even had to buy a larger size pants because even though I hadn’t gained any weight my belly was grossly distended and any external pressure increased the intense discomfort. I have taken several other digestive enzymes in the past, and the brand I order most often had more than doubled in price. After a good bit of research, I found this brand at half price without some of the controversial, fillers and preservatives that are in the more popular brands. When they arrived, I took a couple and the Relief was fast and things were finally moving along. If I forget to take them when I eat, I puff right back up! I never notice any real difference when I took other brands of enzymes however with this brand I am really feeling a noticeable and notable difference! While it will take months to get my gut back to it former happy state. I feel confident that taking these when I eat along with a variety of gut friendly foods and fibers (Dr. told me for optimal digestion we need to eat 14 different types of fibers a week; fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes) I believe these work so well because of the added digestive aids, prebiotics and probiotics. With age, chemicals, medicines, environmental toxins, processed food, being less active, dehydration, etc.our digestive system weakens so it makes sense to provide it with additional assistance to keep things humming along, absorb more nutrients, produce more bile and clean out waste. Taste a bit minty with, No nasty aftertaste Standard capsule size Very Effective  I recommend this product!",165

A gastroenterologist (without getting my baseline) suggested less fiber, then more fiber and prescribed Linzess, which I opted not to take because it can cause the opposite problem and I am too active for that. I meet my personal trainer 4 days a week and sleep well. I did not want to mess with that. I finally tried this stuff. It is wonderful! I appear to be back on track. I recently read that seniors (I am almost 72) lose the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol and I certainly drink much less than I used to.

Then I found Physicians Choice Digestive Enzymes.  And baby—when I tell you these pills delivered me? I don’t mean metaphorically. I mean I took one and then ate a full slice of cheesecake like a normal human. I braced for the ritual. I waited for the stomach cramps, the urgent dread, the cold porcelain altar. But nothing came.

The manufacturer P&G has changed from a bister pack where you pop out individual pills to a bottle that I guess provides enough of a seal to keep the product from degrading. A change that makes sense (though they still have way larger boxes than they need). Note though that they have made 2 other changes:  1. Each capsule in the new version contains 10mg of the same probiotic as the old version which contains 20mg. Because there are no standards for recommended daily values of supplements they have simply said that one 10mg capsule is now a standard ""serving"" when it was one 20mg capsule before. Will this make any functional difference for people? It's hard to say, but if you aren't getting a theraputic effect from the new version it may be because you are taking half as much as you used to and need to take 20mg again. This of course makes this product twice as expensive since you are paying the same price for half as much active ingredient.  2. They changed hypromellose to hydroxypropyl methylcellulose on the other ingredients list. These are actually two names for the same compound so there isn't really a change to the supplement itself.  I'll keep taking one capsule a day, but if I detect an increase in digestive issues I'll need to double the dose and then I'll be contacting P&G.",100

I had been drinking just light beer (Corona Light) but not every bar in my area has them. In fact, most of them don’t. This was one of these times where it wasn’t offered, so I ordered a Corona Extra and figured I’d deal with the gas later.

Healthy and active. I had a bit of mid belly fat. I have been using this product for the last 3 months.  Pros: 1. Regulate my bowel movement - I am very consistent for the last three months with progressively better after each month. I have 3 months data to track it (Daily bowl freq 0, 1, 2, 3 for the last 3.5 months). It was an improvement over my previous 6 months. Having said that I also increase my leafy green and fruits consumptions. I suspect the improvement factors are combination of both. This product is excellent for bowel movement control. If you have IBS I highly recommend it.  2. Control Appetite - This is something I didn't expect having such an impact on me. I was a ""big eater"". Since using this product, my appetite reduced 30%. But at the same time I also try to shrink my eating period to 10 hours or less. If you are into weight control or even lose weight the ""side effect"" might be good. If you want to take in more calories to gain weight, please consider this side effect. But my mid belly (fat) is gone. My ""waistline"" (belly button circumference - not the pant's waistline is reduced by 3 inches from 37 to 34.  Cons:  1. Body Weight - Due to losing about 30% of the appetite (technically the appetite is there but the capacity reduced by 30%) my weight dropped a lot. It was great initially since that was my goal. After 3 months I got a little bit concern and the ""appetite control"" factor didn't ring any bell. I ended up doing more PCP visit thinking there might be something wrong with me. Watch your dosage if you are into training/muscle gain program.  2. Gas - As I mentioned, I added more leafy green and fruits to my diet. I was doing smoothie every other day. Now combining a high fiber diet with this product, I had a period of 3 days of excessive gas pain (you do need to take a lot of water to prevent bloating). I didn't realize that since I hardly experienced gas problem. Finally it came to me. Watch out if you switching to a high fiber diet and taking this product at the same time.  These are the four main factors I want to mention to give this product a fair review.",340

I have seen improvements in my skin, hair, and nails. Cellulite has nearly entirely vanished. My face seems smoother.  The two have similar consistencies. Garden of Life appears finer, but Vital Proteins dissolves slightly better. There's really little difference there, so that should not be the deciding factor.  Neither has a detectable flavor as far as I can tell.  Garden of Life is MUCH less expensive. You'll save around $10 a container with Garden of Life.  The ingredients in both seem to be high quality. The amino acid breakdown is comparable in both.  But they are not duplicates.  With Garden of Life, I noticed bloating, increased appetite, and weight gain. This is because it contains a probiotic in addition to the collagen peptides. Not everyone tolerates this probiotic, lactobacillus plantarum, well.  I am now attempting to flush this flora out and replace it with other types of probiotics that have not caused bloating. I worked very hard to achieve my ideal weight and a flat stomach. It was disappointing to me to find myself looking 3 1/2 months pregnant and the scale showing pounds I thought I'd lost forever.  It may take some time as this particular probiotic is known for sticking around.  Vital Proteins does not contain a probiotic. Instead, it contains hyaluronic acid in addition to the collagen peptides.  Therefore, I reordered Vital Proteins. I could use the hyaluronic acid.  If lactobacillus plantarum agrees with you, then save the money and go for Garden of Life.  If not, then I'd recommend Vital Proteins instead.  If Garden of Life were to produce a collagen peptide powder with no probiotic, then it would probably be worth switching. But for now, it's worth spending the extra ten bucks and keeping a flat stomach, thank you.  For this reason, I gave Garden of Life a 4 stars rather than 5. Others had remarked on the bloating issue and I had hoped I would not have the same experience; however, I did.",1

Within 3 days or so after I started this supplement I developed itchy skin, a rash on my thighs and on the right side of my neck right below the hairline. Around the same timeline I also developed a severe runny nose, post nasal drip (sorry for the gross details) itchy throat. I was sneezing all day constantly for 3 weeks straight. I did not connect the dots and realize that the rash and the respiratory symptoms seemed to stem from the same root cause.  Coincidentally around the same time I had started on an at home decluttering/cleaning project in which I was cleaning up my attic and garage space and dealing with a significant amount of dust for about a week or two. I simply assumed maybe I was having symptoms of some kind of seasonal allergies mixed in with the dust Inhaled from cleaning.  It wasn't until after I was done with my decluttering project and realized I was still sneezing and having a runny nose almost 24-7 that I started to suspect there might be something else going on. Then came the itchy burning lips from hell. My lips started to show signs of what looked and felt like angular cheilitis. Cracked mouth corners that was burning and stinging. At first it was the corners but then my entire lip ...top and bottom became intensely itchy sore, sometimes even to the point of bleeding after I use my teeth scratch the itch. They also started to develop a bumpy scaly rough rash and began to darken significantly in color. My lips started to look like I chain smoke 2 dozen packs of cigarettes a day. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything in my entire life so this was quite startling and alarming for me. I had finished one tub of this powder and was halfway through my second tub when all this came to a head. The funny thing is I thought since I had made it through an entire container and was on the second that I was past the worse and I wouldn't end up in that small percentage of people who react to collagen supplements.  I decided to discontinue taking this product and the itchy lips subsided almost immediately. It took almost an entire month however before the dark crusty pigment on my lips cleared up. This was quite an experience and it saddens me to have to discontinue consuming this because I'm almost certain it made my skin start to glow like when I was in my 20's, hair felt softer/ healthier etc. In full disclosure I also started taking some bamboo silica supplements about 2 weeks or so after I started the Garden of life collagen powder and I struggled with wether or not to attribute my symptoms to that product. I made sure I discontinued taking both the GOL collagen powder and the silica supplement just to be safe. I have restarted taking the bamboo silica again and so far no issues. For now I have to assume it was the Garden of life product that I was reacting to or perhaps its a combination of taking both at the same time, Im not sure if collagen overload is a thing but for now I'm discontinuing this for the fore-seeable future . If anything changes I will update this review to reflect that.  One last thing to add the powder was tasteless to me which was a plus but it I found that it did leave some lumps that didn't blend well when mixing it with my protein shake which I mix with cold water. I have never tried it in hot liquids.",78

My skin looks healthier and more hydrated and I've also noticed less stiffness in my joints, which has been a big win since I am starting a healthier lifestyle by going to the gym more frequently.  One of the best things about this collagen powder is that it’s completely unflavored—no weird aftertaste or smell. That makes it super easy to mix into anything, whether it's a smoothie, juice, or even just water if you are in a rush.  I also appreciate that it’s made from grass-fed, pasture-raised sources and doesn’t include any unnecessary additives or sweeteners.

Nails still thin, skin still same / more wrinkles. Btw we took pictures of these things when we started and at the end to compare (posted in our mens group site). There were some changes, sadly skin was more wrinkled, I'm sure not from product but just from aging. 1 person said he thought his digestion was better. 1 of the men in our group is a scientist from a well known cosmetics mfg company. He initially said there studies showed collagen creams, lotions, oils and oral supplements don't work at all. Every scientist in this field knows this but it's a money maker he said. Anyways we're all moving on to another product we are trying ""ashwagandha"".  Initial review: I started using the product may 21st 2021. I have not been using it long enough to see really much of anything yet, but can give some initial pros and cons.  Pro: Dissolves really well in hot water. Tastes like mild bone broth in distilled water. When I mix in my coffee I really cannot tastes it. That's good Seems like maybe my joints hurt less. Like I said, seems. Not sure. Must continue. Cons: Pricey for only 28 day supply. (Weird 28 days). It's not like the container couldn't hold 30 days. Hmm Arginine- says apx 1436mg. Well I have to take Arginine with my blood pressure meds. I take 1500mg per day for over 3 years. So, naturally I stopped because this has it. Wrong! I believe it has very little to no Arginine. My body / blood pressure reacts to the Arginine my doctor prescribed. After several days I had to start taking my Arginine again. BTW it's from Thorne labs, so not prescription grade. Just off the shelf. I even take a cheaper brand "" spring valley"" and it works fine, so although this is not a deal breaker and I will buy more of this collagen for at least 6 months to see if I get any benefits. One has to ask if there is little to no Arginine in this what else is not in there that they are stating? Either there quality control in not good or, well, you know must be false advertising. I will purchase from another batch and if the same results then we can be sure of one thing right? I will report back in another month or 2.  Update- after 9 months in I have to report I still do not see any positive results. My nails are still as fragile as they were, my skin shows no changes. I have pictures from beginning and no change. I spoke with a friend who is a PhD scientist for a well know company that formulates supplements and make-up bases and such for other companies and he said after many years of study that collagen weather ingested or applied topically does nothing. But he said millions of people are under the allusion that it works so there still willing to dish out the money for it. I committed to 1 year of trying this so I will see it out but I fear the results will be the same. Stay tuned. Btw I have a group of friends around my age group who also started when I did and they report zero positive side effects. On the other had some reported negative effects, gas, stomach pain, headaches etc. So there's that.",108

I've been taking a scoop in my morning coffee every day. FYI I add the scoop to my hot coffee and let it dissolve on its own. It does that fairly quickly. I wait to stir it until after it dissolves on its own into the coffee. Otherwise it can create lumps. I also don't detect any taste when I put it in my coffee, so five stars for that and how easy it dissolves.  The biggest difference I'm noticing is that my nails are long and strong and my skin is no longer crepey. To be fair, I've got fairly strong nails to begin with. However, as I'm getting olde, I noticed they were getting brittle and kept chipping and breaking. Not any more. All ten of my nails are long and pretty.  I've also noticed an improvement in the crepey skin on my hands and arms, and my neck and chest. About a month ago, I started using a retinol body lotion, and slowly noticed an improvement, especially right after I apply the lotion. At first I thought the lotion was causing the reduction in crepey skin. However after the lotion ran out, I realized it was this collagen that was making my skin look better, not the lotion.  Where I haven't really noticed any difference is in my hair. I've been using an expensive hair loss shampoo and conditioner, too, but my hair looks the same to me. Not noticing any new growth to speak of. I'm going to research and look for a hair growth supplement to take in addition to this collagen.  Also I haven't noticed any improvement in my joint pain and aches. However, I recently had knee surgery, so that could be why. I'll give it a little more time to see if my joint aches improve. But what this has done for my nails and skin alone earns this product five stars.",80

The creams, Botox, and fillers i do just weren't cutting it anymore. I have taken collagen sourced from shellfish a couple of years ago that did seem like it helped my skin tone and quality, but i learned i was allergic to shellfish, so that was the end of that! So, i went in search of a collagen supplement made from something else. That is when I found this product. Granted, i was skeptical, but i knew how my skin looked so much fuller and brighter on the other type, so what the heck... i ordered some.  After taking it for three days, i started noticing my facial tone looked brighter. After 5 days, I woke up to a much fuller looking face and my wrinkles under my eyes were less visible. This morning when i woke up, i noticed my crow's feet and smile lines had diminished as well and the skin on my hands was fuller too. I am sold... this stuff is like finding the foundation of youth. It has also helped the mild back pain i sometimes get the next morning after running, and i just found out it helps control and stabilize blood sugar... yippie! i put one scoop full in a coffee cup and add 8 oz of coffee and some cream in the morning. That's it. It dissolves smoothly and has no taste.  Overall, I can't wait to see what results i have after two weeks, when it has made such a difference after only 1 week. Well worth the money and comparing it to even the stuff i saw at Costco for the same price with only 8g of protein, it is a great value! Word of advice, i just wish i would have taken before and after pics of my face. So, if you buy a can of this, do that. I think you will be amazed at the results the way i was... :-)",64

Although it still has a little funky taste to me, it’s a lot better than trying to mix it cold. It’s definitely easier to drink and I’m getting used to the taste. I’m now 3 wks in and still waiting to see some results. I’ll update again once I finish my container.  This review is based solely on taste* Im only right over two weeks in using this, so not much can be said for its quality yet. But I am really struggling to get past the taste. This is my first time ever trying collagen, so idk what’s normal taste wise. But it doesn’t dissolve well at all. There are always still very gooey chunks that won’t dissolve even when I mash them repeatedly. As for the taste, well it smells almost similar to powdered milk, but has a twangy taste if that makes sense. It’s hard to describe, but to me, it’s strong. I’m struggling to find ways to mix it and drink it. I don’t drink coffee, I do tea, but the taste is so strong I’m worried i still won’t be able to drink it and it’s just gonna ruin my tea. I’ve tried to drink it in chocolate milk bc I thought surely that would mask the flavor, but no. I add a lot of chocolate powder too. I count calories, so it isn’t ideal having to add so much of something to be able to drink it. Almost makes me wish I would have just tried a flavored one. No improvements yet, but again, only two weeks in. But I think I’m going to have to try something else when this is finished bc the taste is just too much.

I spoke to my physical therapist and he stated it may take 6 months for joint relief. OK. Fine. I will do it for another 4 months. Now, the good. I only place a serving in my morning coffee.

If you use cream in your coffee or milk in your tea, that should mask it entirely.  The scoop is small and as you progress through the bottle it will become practically inaccessible at the bottom of the container.

We stopped using the powder for several months to see if hair loss would return to previous levels and we did see an increase. So we use this powder daily...one scoop in our coffee each morning. The powder is very fine and dissolves quickly in the hot coffee. It adds no flavor or off taste to the coffee. It dissolves completely and doesn't change the texture.,8

So I got the product before 3pm today after ordering it at 9:30 this morning. Good job Amazon first and foremost. The three choices on the back of the container says shake in water, mix in with smoothie or use in baked recipes. Well I broke the rules and decided to take my first dose with my coffee at work. I know, I know…. I heard about caffeine reducing collagen synthesis but I’m just really experimenting right now with mixing options to see what’s acceptable for me. I had no desire to shake this powder into my water just yet. Anyway, I read a review that I will agree totally with. The person who gave the trick of mixing the powder with the coffee was absolutely correct! Stir it in hot coffee. Let it sit for a moment and the coffee will get a tiny layer of froth on the surface and in a moment the coffee will turn back black again and you know it’s all dissolved. I’m a cream and sugar person and I’m pretty sure that the powder actually enhanced the roast flavor of my morning coffee. I will be paying close attention to see if I see any improvements in any of the areas that this product claims to support and will report back directly. I will also break down and try all three other methods of mixing and let you know how that went as well. If this product makes good on its claims I will definitely inform the Amazon community and give it my official consumers stamp of approval! I’ll talk to you guys in about 30 days.",75

So my bar for collagen supplements was pretty much in the basement, and I was thinking maybe they were all similar. I decided to try again though, and bought the Garden of Life collagen because I've tried their supplements in the past, and they were OK, and the price seemed reasonable. So far I can say that there is no weird smell (almost no smell at all), and the flavor is almost unnoticeable (but I can still detect a hint of beef). I've only tried this with coffee and juice so far, and between those, I did not notice it in the coffee, but I did detect it in the juice (I was also using just a teaspoon full in a large mug). It seems to blend very easily in hot or cold liquids which is a big plus. But due to the very slight flavor, I don't think I could use it in a smoothie. So it's not perfect, but leagues better than then last one I tried. I don't yet know if there will be any benefits or not, but I will update this review if I perceive any benefits (or side effects). I'm planning to try at least one more brand when I run out, since there may be one out there that is truly ""unflavored"".",60

I am post menopausal and experience a host of symptoms that come along with it. The most annoying was the intense hip pain I had been experiencing, especially at night when trying to sleep. For months, no matter what position I tried to sleep in, the pain kept me rotating like a rotisserie chicken. I've never been a great sleeper. I have always woke up numerous times a night, but this pain had me tossing and turning all night, with little rest. I was beginning to resemble a zombie, getting up even more tired than when I had turned in the night before. Something had to change! So after seeing adverts for this, I thought, Why not? The worse thing that could happen would be that I would have spent money on yet another thing that didn't work. I honestly didn't want to expect much, but thought that even a slight relief would be worth it. I am really, really glad I purchased this. It has been nothing short of a miracle product for me. Even before I was half way through my first bottle, I was already experiencing joint and hip pain relief. I had read that it could take up to 90 days, but here I was only about 15 days in and the pain was at least half what it had been previously. By the end of the first bottle, I was sleeping much better and even able to sleep on my side, which is my preferred sleeping position since a child. For months prior to this, I hadn't been able to stay on my side for more than a couple of minutes , as the pain would become too much to tolerate. I was amazed. I know this seems like an infomercial right now, but my testimony is true. Before I finished the first bottle, I had already ordered 3 more. It might not be cheap, but in my experience, it is powerful and worth every penny. I can't imagine going without this at any point. I'm now sleeping much better and deeper and I don't think I resemble a morning zombie anymore. I'm so impressed I just ordered two more products from this company as well.",93

Whether it be Amazon or the company, I have no idea.  I first ordered Provitalize in the summer of 2023. I had previously watched a video on Provitalize that suggested taking it for 3 months for best results. So, I kept that in mind after I completed the first 3 bottles and had my daughter order me a second round - 3 more bottles. At first, it seemed to be a decent product; I seemed to have more energy in the beginning. However, the first thing this product did was completely stopped my monthly cycle in September. I had almost completed the 4th bottle of Provitalize in November, but I noticed the product had completely stopped working, and instead of decreasing the bloating, it had increased the bloating - more than I had ever experienced before. Without changing my eating habits, I had gained 8 pounds since starting this product.  Barbara O’Neill says, “The body will tell you what it needs. We just have to learn to listen to our bodies.”  I never really understood what that meant until I was taking Provitalize, because my body felt an overwhelming urge to have a monthly cycle that Provitalize had completely stopped. So, I stopped taking Provitalize around the 3rd week of November. After around 4 days without Provitalize, my bloating decreased. After around 6 days without Provitalize, I went down 5 pounds on the scales. And 9 days without Provitalize, my monthly cycle returned, and my body is starting to feel normal again.  I will never order this product again. I truly believe Provitalize is just another money gimmick sales pitch product that preys on women who desire to live healthier lifestyles.  Might I also add a few other facts: First, when I ordered the Provitalize, I also ordered Raw Sea Moss from another company, and I took the two together. I used all the Sea Moss in September and haven’t gotten around to reordering it, and now that all is said and done, I believe with all my heart, the results that I did see in the beginning were coming from the Raw Sea Moss and NOT the Provitalize (like more energy). Secondly, in the spring of 2023, I purchased an entire line of haircare products to strengthen, thicken, and grow my hair, which was working 100% UNTIL I started taking Provitalize. Now my hair is back to dull and thinning, and I fully blame Provitalize for that. (I mean, the hair products were working. I started taking Provitalize and the hair products stopped working. I stopped using Provitalize and the hair products are working again.)  That is my experience with Provitalize, and why I will never take this product again!  Edited to add: Ladies, if you're searching for a product to help with menopause or any female/hormonal issues, please research Wild Yam Cream! :)",2

I did experience a lot of intestinal cramping as well as extra uterus cramping… then came the body aches and breast tenderness By the end of the third week, the slimming down the middle was not worth the new aches and pains I had while the night sweats even came back with day sweating. I decided to stop this because I literally felt like I needed to see a doctor— something was attacking me. I switched to another probiotic that doesn’t work quite as well as far as keeping me regular however, the aches are going away. I will say I tried a third probiotic that also made me ache. I think I have it nailed down to the B Breve that has caused me problems. I know I sound crazy, but that’s the only difference between the one that doesn’t bother me vs the two that do bother me. ** Update, I did read that the aches could be due to the toxins released from the good bacteria killing whatever there was so maybe this was doing me a favor. (Btw if you tell a doctor you think your probiotic is causing you aches they will think you are crazy… even when you absolutely know that’s the culprit.) I decided to retry this and get thru it. I started up again and just took some Advil for the aches and pains and so far I’m fine. A couple days later I don’t need Advil. If that changes I will start Advil again or try cutting back to one capsule or something. It does help with the slimming down so other than some of the aches I feel younger as far as my figure goes. While I do really like this, I do have concerns that all of us that are taking this are bandaiding something. Sure the probiotic ingredients are beneficial but why is it that middle aged women get so bloated and carry fat around their waist. There has to be something else we are doing wrong… or perhaps this is just another thing we have unrealistic expectations about when we age. 2nd update: I’ve been using this for about 11 months and with changing my diet to more fiber I am able to take 1 capsule instead of 2 which will cut the cost of this in half. Also, I bought a cavitation machine. Prior to buying one, I researched it and had a professional do my first treatment at a salon. It’s a lot like cool sculpting but much cheaper. Anyway, this has also helped with slimming/melting the stress/hormonal fat around the belly. I’m feeling the best I have in a couple of years.",2

I ordered the Provitalize, after reading the review. I received them on the 10th of September. I started taking them mid month. One of the first side effect was a weird feeling. It kinda amazed me to how strong it was. I took 2 every morning, went to work. I had the sensation to go to the bathroom, but nothing. I did urinate, and it was cloudy and had a strong odor. These side effects was nothing I ever had. Then things started to get yucky. One thing I DID not expect was that I totally lost my appetite. I was drinking my water, I carry a bottle of water and ice with me. The last straw was when the urine came out. It was cloudy and stunk to high heaven like something died and was rotting! A couple of days of that was all I could take. I quit taking them after 5 days, and the day after I stopped I started cramping and felt like my period was coming, I had a hysterectomy 20 years ago. I took HRT for 15 years. My choice to use them and to cut them out. I didn't have them for more than 3weeks, so it was in the 30 day guarantee to return them to Amazon. I did the thing to return them, but with BB Company, had a questionnaire to answer. I did all that, but let them know that I wasn't taking the pills. We went back and forth, and finally they agreed to honor the guarantee. Now even I know that some people can't take just any kind of supplement. I'm not one of those people. I have a pretty good track record of taking meds, either prescribed or on my own. Now I saw both sides of the penny. B&B agreed to refund me the $ and it was in Amazon account the same day! The people who written in to say how it worked for them and only good things. Then, there the ones who had taken them, with not good side effects.  The company LISTENED to me. And for that I'm grateful. It's like anything in life you choose, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. I was on the losing team. Just remember that there are 2 sides and until you take them, you won't know which side you are on.  After you read this, it's your decision. You're an adult.

I have fibromyalgia, systematic lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis for about 17 years and have been in pre menopause for a few years. So vitolize seemed to offer all the marks I needed. I've been on it for 2 months so far. I can say honestly, i noticed an increase in energy the first week. i usually get pretty worn out quickly but these pills have helped immensely with my energy level. I love how i don't feel jittery or crazy like other weight loss pills made me feel. I don't seem to be as achey either. i am on prescribed pain pills, but noticed whatever the pain my pills miss, this covers. Weight loss wasn't instant, but i did notice my stomach, which had turned into my problem area with recent weight gain, was definitely less bloated and changing, shrinking. I poop way more regularly too. I haven't weighed myself since ive been on these, I'm trying not to obsess with numbers and focus more on how i feel, but all the pants that were either tight or not fitting, now fit comfortably. There were some clothes i couldn't even get up my legs before and now they fit. I definitely notice body parts seen smaller, such as stomach, thighs and arms. One other thing i love is only having to take 2 in the morning instead of how other brands are more than once a day which i would always forget. and they dont smell! My only complaint is the price. it's pricey. I'm getting ready to order my 3rd bottle to continue this journey and I'm on a fixed income so $50 a bottle is a lot for me UPDATE: I'm on my 4th month and i can definitely say I've lost inches all over my body. i feel way better, more comfortable and less sluggish. i think the trick is to stick with it. usually i would never stay this dedicated to something if i wasn't seeing results right away. but since i did notice a change in my energy level pretty quickly, i kept with it and then really started to see the results by the 3rd month.",1

Everybody's body is different, so what works for one may not work for another. I am 51 years old and in very good health and in pretty good physical condition. When I turned 50, everything changed. I started menopause, my joints started aching, I gained 25 pounds, the night sweats started, the hot flashes, and the constant mood swings took over my life. I have been taking these pills for 7 days and I can honestly say that the night sweats and hot flashes have eased up and I have finally gotten a good night sleep. I have also noticed my appetite has decreased and I'm not as bloated. I'm getting a little pain relief, so I'm hoping that improves with continued use. I haven't experienced weight lose but if I do that will be a plus. I don't know if this will work for you but if you buy it from their site, you are offered a 90 day money back guarantee.

First, I am not having weight problems at all post menopause, so perhaps it works better for people who are having that problem. I wanted help with sleep and hip pain. I was determined to go the full 90 days before making a judgment, but at 6 weeks I started getting strong joint and muscle pain everywhere. It was disruptive to life. I saw that others had this problem, I am aware that the manufacturer says this can be from the release of bad bacteria, but I couldn't get through it - had an attack of pain on one knee without any injury, twisting, etc that was so bad I had to use crutches for a couple of days.

I am 47 and started experiencing hot flashes this year, weight is difficult to take off (well, more difficult than usual), emotions run high, etc. I was walking around with a portable fan and would use it whenever I had hot flashes. AC on full blast that my husband, who normally runs hot, would complain that it was too cold, while I was visibly flushed.  I came across this product on TikTok via an ad. So, I Googled it. When I did, there were a lot of good reviews all stating that this product helped with the symptoms. Some bad, some so-so. Considering that I need/should be on probiotics anyway, I figured it would not hurt to try it. It's been almost one month and I just signed up to the Subscribe and Save. During the time that I have been religiously taking two pills every morning (per directions) my hot flashes have stopped. My joint pain has improved. Can't say much for weight loss, because I won't step on the scale, but I do feel overall better. Not sure how long it will last, or if it'll work when I officially enter menopause, but so far so good. The price - approximately $50 a month - is a bit steep, but it's probiotics and the good ones tend to be a bit expensive. So, I am okay with it.  So, if you have symptoms, give it a one month try and see if it helps. Definitely worth a try.  UPDATE: I've been taking this supplement for over a year and have not had hot flashes. They have stopped! Weight loss has and is a struggle, so it has only really helped for hot flashes.  UPDATE: For some reason, this product was on auto ship but never delivered due to being out of stock. So I had not taken it for a month, and the hot flashes have returned with a vengeance! I can’t sleep and during the day, I am far from comfortable. I was able to get a new bottle yesterday and have started it up again. Hopefully, within a week or so the hot flashes will subside.",77

Let's start by going back to April of 2024. I had my gallbladder removed. While I have not had any issues whatsoever with not being able to eat certain foods, or certain foods making me sick...I have had other issues. I did gain a significant amount of weight from April to December of 2024 I gained just under 30 pounds. I was always feeling bloated, and constantly had issues with constipation. Moving forward to 2025....from January to February I lost 25 pounds (down to 119 lbs) and was finally feeling a bit better. BUT, I was still having so many issues with my gut health. After tons of research, I decided to give these probiotics a whirl. When I say that after taking the recommended dose everyday for 1 week...I am FINALLY feeling good...I AM NOT JOKING. I am using the bathroom daily, my stomach feels soft and not bloated, I feel less sluggish. This is a major win in my book.

The dosage makes sense—enough calcium to support bones and muscles, paired with vitamin D3 to actually help your body absorb it. I appreciate that it’s gluten-free and free from artificial flavors, which keeps things simple.  The softgels are on the larger side, which is typical for calcium, but they’re smooth and go down more easily than chalky tablets. I don’t notice an aftertaste, and there’s no lingering flavor. I usually take them with meals as suggested, and they haven’t upset my stomach. The bottle is well-sized and priced better than many alternatives, especially considering the potency and the brand’s reputation.  The only thing to keep in mind is pill size—if you struggle with swallowing larger softgels, this might not be the best fit. Otherwise, it’s a straightforward supplement that does exactly what it should without extra fillers.  Bottom line: A reliable, no-frills calcium and vitamin D3 supplement that’s well-priced, easy enough to take, and backed by a brand I trust.",3

I've attempted to watch my carb and gluten intake to mitigate the issue, however, I struggled to determine which foods were creating the issue. These gummies have definitely caused some regularity, and the probiotic seems to be reducing the boating. These are the first fiber supplements with probiotics I've taken and chose them because of the brand. I remember my mom taking this brand in the powder form. I have not checked the price points on others, but find these to be a bit pricey; however if they continue to work i would say it's worth it.

Or while working being comfortable I could attend a two hour meeting without worry. I have tried a variety of pre and probiotic offerings out there, from capsules to gummies. Some helped, while it seemed like others may have hindered.  I stumbled on these one day and decided to give them a try. All I can say is these have been life changing for me. While not everything is perfect, these are the only things I've tried where I have had tangible and more importantly, consistent results. The number of emergency issues we all dread has been reduced to next to nothing, and I can't put into words how much freedom that has provided me.  The fact they taste good is just a bonus. I also wanted to wait about a year of having used these to post a review, and these have been consistent for me. The only two downsides I can offer is the lack of availability at times, and some bottles have harder gummies than others. My most recent order of two bottles of 60 were the exception. They came packed with an ice pack, and are the most chewy of any batch (June 2025). As of writing this review, the 60 count bottle is not availalble yet again. So I wish the supply was a bit better, since these are game changing for me, and I get anxiety if I have trouble sourcing them. I learned to order early so I always have ample supply.  While there are a lot of products I've bought on Amazon, this is one of the few that has been life changing for me, and for that, I'm truly thankful for this product because it actually worked when I was getting to the point of exhausting my options.",48

The first thing I noticed was a slight decrease in my appetite, especially between meals, which helped me control my cravings. It also gave me a feeling of fullness a little faster when eating.  Not everything was perfect: the first few days I had some stomach discomfort (mild nausea and some gas), but over time it regulated itself. It's important to take it with enough water and not skip meals, otherwise your body will feel the effects.  As for results, I did notice that I've lost a few pounds and feel more in control of my eating, although it's not a miraculous change either. I think it works best as a support alongside a good diet and some physical activity, not as a magic bullet.  Overall, I think it's a good supplement for those looking for an extra boost in appetite control, but you have to be consistent and listen to your body. I would recommend it, with the clarification that each person's reaction may be different.  Llevo varias semanas probando este suplemento GLP-1 y quería compartir mi experiencia real. Lo primero que noté fue una ligera disminución en el apetito, sobre todo entre comidas, lo cual me ayudó a controlar los antojos. También me dio una sensación de saciedad un poco más rápida al comer.  No todo fue perfecto: los primeros días tuve algo de malestar estomacal (ligera náusea y algo de gases), pero con el tiempo se fue regulando. Es importante tomarlo con suficiente agua y no saltarse comidas, porque si no, el cuerpo lo resiente.  En cuanto a resultados, sí noté que he bajado unas libras y me siento con más control sobre mi alimentación, aunque tampoco es un cambio milagroso. Creo que funciona mejor como apoyo junto a una buena dieta y algo de actividad física, no como una solución mágica.  En general, me parece un buen suplemento para quien busca un empujón extra en el control del apetito, pero hay que ser constante y escuchar al cuerpo. Lo recomendaría, con la aclaración de que cada persona puede reaccionar distinto.",12

While several reviews described an after-taste, I did not experience any such after-taste. I liked the price of this supplement especially compared to the price of other supplements I have purchased in the past. However, I also experienced nasty gas and painful bloating while taking this supplement. I read other reviews that stated they did as well and that the side-effects would subside with use. After over a week of taking, I was still experiencing the same issues with no relief. I googled what to do and the AI suggested that I reduce the amount I was taking. Since I was having severe issues, I reduced my intake to 1 capsule every day with the intent of building up to 1 per day and then 2 per day which is the recommended daily dosage on the bottle. The gas did not subside and some days I would have several loose bowel movements a day and other days, nothing - which would leave me feeling worse. I really wanted to like this supplement and saw other reviews that discussed the affects of less food noise and feeling fuller longer. Unfortunately, this supplement did not react well with my system. Would I recommend to others? I'd recommend that you try to understand what your body needs and how your body may react before starting the supplement and I'd recommend starting slow and increasing over time.",22

This supplement was created to GLP1 BUT, on a more Natural level.  But, as I mentioned below, you need to also “do the work…” as I or they say. Never expect any supplement (or really anything food, right??), to be magic or work overnight.  This supplement is super easy to take- definitely but again- give it time to work! I always try to give products, skincare, supplements and more 3-months or so before expecting results…..  This supplement is also a great price, especially when comparing it to the medication, shots, appointments and more BUT, always remember to still be smart and safe because side effects and more can still occur with supplements! When this is on sale, definitely stock-up. Be smart!  All good things will take time to work, including this! This product is for both, Women & Men! In time, this supplement can help support weight loss and all the benefits that come with losing extra weight. This has probiotic and prebiotics in it, which can really help support the gut in super healthy ways and more (research to learn more).  This supplement may also help with, energy, mental clarity, stamina, constant hunger, digestive support and more.  * As always this supplement, or any is NOT magic! You need to eat well, workout, walk AND make all the healthy choices you are able to do while taking! 🧘‍♀️  Unfortunately- I can’t give a full review as this is not something I have been taking religiously for a long time BUT, so far so good, the ingredients seem great and more.

I suffer from very powerful food noise, I’ve woken up out of dead sleep hungry before. When I had a good dinner so there was no reason. I know I’m full, but my body will still act hungry.  So far, I have been taking 2 in the morning with my smoothie. And I absolutely do notice a difference, I’m not physically thinking about food, it quiets that unnecessary food noise for sure! It’s made an insanely positive difference in my day to day life so far and I do plan to continue to use this.  Now, with that in mind. No pill is magic, nothing is going to just shred fat without effort, and if it does well your body probably won’t be too happy about that. With this you still have to be active and healthy, this isn’t a weight shredding magic pill, it does make you lose weight though because you aren’t consuming extra unnecessary foods. If you have a binge/food noise issue, this really does work in my opinion.  My only con is definitely eat something or have a smoothie, just anything In your stomach, I took it on an empty stomach just to see and it kept me on the toilet for the rest of the day. It does state it online and on the bottle to eat with it though, so that was just my own little experiment that I will not be doing again lol.  Again, don’t have unrealistic expectations and this will be a great product for you!",66

I am 47, 5'11, and 214lbs with a goal to loose 14lbs or at most be at 195lbs. When I first read the instructions it was two a day. I took one after a meal and as a person who sit on the toilet everyday. I notice that this medicine did two things within a hour or two. It wiped out any appetite for food and stop my digestive system from moving. I did not take another pill for four days. My advice is to take one pill and do not take another one until you use the bathroom. If you take another pill without using the restroom you will make it very hard for yourself. This is a medication that definitely works but it works differently contingent upon your body size and weight. Would I recommend it. I would recommend you take one pill on an empty stomach. and then wait 30 minutes and eat a light meal. I am a person who loved sweets like banana pudding, brownies and ice cream, cakes and cookies. Now I can walk right past it without an issue. I would say this curves appetite tremendously but it also does not allow your digestive system to move so proceed with caution and do. I am only in three weeks and lost 2 pounds but by belly fat has went down a lot. I am sure that is because of the sweets.",63

Since we started taking it, we’ve both noticed feeling more satisfied after meals and having fewer cravings throughout the day 🍽️. That has really helped us maintain a more balanced diet without feeling restricted.  Another big plus is that it combines probiotics and prebiotics, which means it not only helps with appetite control but also supports digestive health.

When I first got them they made me gassy they made me nauseous and they made me sleepy. Yeah I got the side effects okay but it takes time to get your body regulated if your body is feeling like crap and doing like crap you're going to get crap from that pill first because it's got a whole lot of mess to straighten out. If you're having gas it's because that probiotic and probiotic are working on your body to get your body straightened out. If you stop when it starts in the beginning it's not going to do its job because you're not allowing it to do its work. Yeah I even got headaches over it but it was just something that my body was getting used to I don't have them anymore.  I don't have the nauseousness anymore. And it's normal to have gas when you eat You're human being You're going to have gas .I mean get over yourself.  Even people that are dead have gas they ferment until they rot. If you turn to human body inside out we all stink.  But the fact of it is these things have to get your colon in check it does what you didn't do. It's got all those little microbe organisms in there that's eating all the bad stuff and putting in the good stuff and doing what you need to get done for your body. Yeah it makes me sleepy but it's also fixes your serotonin in your body  Which said also helps to fight your fat on your belly. And with all that being done your body is more relaxed and working like it should. All the things that people have side effects are not really what you call side effects they're just getting used to  what's the probiotics and prebiotics are doing.  And as far as the after-effect on the taste all I taste is what I would be tasting if I had echinacea, are the powder that you buy in the store that in place of greens and they taste like raspberries or strawberries That's the same aftertaste that I taste when I take those two nothing bad.  People on here want to exaggerate and talk smack about this thing like it's really bad and awful. Their deterring you from buying this stuff is what they're doing they're trying to convince you that it's bad, so you don't buy it. Well I don't take people's word for nothing I go check it out myself and I'm sleeping better now I feel better now I don't expect weight loss but I have lost a few pounds.  Today has been two weeks since I've been taking my probiotics and prebiotics. It took about a week to get over all of that and no I'm not constipated no I've not got diarrhea. I'm telling you people do it for yourself you owe it to yourself to get your colon better.  All this thing is doing is making the bad stuff good out of your system. I'm 70 years old and it's made me feel better than I was before I took it. My digestion is better ,My sleep quality is better, The taste is tolerable it's not bad, the value that it cost is great I got me two jars, and they're very easy to swallow.",245

I’ve lost around 2 pounds and don’t feel as hungry between meals. It also helps me avoid late-night snacking, which has always been my weak spot! 🥴 The only downside for me was a bit of an upset stomach during the first few days, but it went away once my body adjusted.

The pills are just as green as the photo, and believe it or not, they smell kind of good, like fruity/earthy. It's weird, but pleasant.

If I knew how GREAT this product was, i definitely would’ve scooped up a few more! I was extremely skeptical about this working - and I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong.  *So full disclosure - I’m taking this with vitamin D3, C, B-complex and iron every day, and I take 5 oxy powder pills by global healing, almost every night. 3 times a week I also take horizon pre+probiotic by Cielo. I also plank for 30 seconds 6 times a day, and I do AT LEAST 80 wall crunches a day (feet on the wall, knees bent 90° & I have my toddler sit on my legs while they’re on the wall for the added weight to keep my legs in place. I do the 80 crunches broken up throughout the day) as well as at least 50 squats. Slight yoga and stretching. I also drink about TEN 16oz water bottles a day. (Men typically need 124oz daily, women need about 92 oz) Drinking water is super important for weight loss, so make sure you’re staying hydrated!* THIS IS WHAT I PERSONALLY DO, PLEASE SPEAK TO YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MIXING VITAMINS & SUPPLEMENTS.  ANYWAY.  I’ve been taking this for about two weeks - I skipped two days (not back to back) because I forgot. I didn’t really notice my hunger being curbed until about a week in. But it did work - I wasn’t craving snacks at night anymore. It also made me feel fuller, quicker. I’d take it about 30 minutes before I ate, and I found myself not wanting to go back for seconds. I looked at myself naked in the mirror today and I was actually shocked to noticed I’m losing the stubborn weight on my lower tummy (baby pooch). Everything combined is definitely working for me, but I can definitely notice the way these pills are standing out and working their magic. I’m so grateful to find something that is actually WORKING and aiding me on my weight loss journey. I’m excited to keep taking it and see where I am two weeks from now. Even though it’s not on sale at the moment - I’d say it works and that the price is worth it. If it’s not on sale when I finally run out of my current supply, I’m still going to buy two bottles. I hope they continue to make this product for yearsss to come.",127

I no longer am consumed by those thoughts 24/7. It works to the point where I notice the difference when I pass something that I would typically would eat or binge on I notice than I’m completely fine without it. They taste fine, they’re very convenient to use. I typically pop two of them in the morning when I’ve gotten a little bit of something in my stomach and go on with my day fine.

I switched from New Chapter zinc to this brand and have had very good results. If you are getting older and want to support your prostate with good health by having a good quality zinc to take then I highly recommend this product!  [Update August 18, 2014] I'm still taking this zinc. I take at night with all my other prostate support supplements. I have found that taking the prostate support supplements just before bedtime gives me a better result than taking them during the day. For those interested in what my prostate support supplements are I thought I would list them.  I take the following just before bedtime:  2 softgels - Now Foods Clinical Strength Prostate Health, Soft-gel, 180-Count 1 softgel - New Chapter Prostate 5LX, 120 Softgels 1 VCap - Garden Of Life Vitamin Code Raw Zinc, 60 Capsules 1 softgel - Zyflamend By New Chapter - 120 Softgels  This gives me the following nutrition:  25mg Zinc (15mg GOL, 10mg NOW) 374mg Saw Palmetto (160mg 5LX, 214mg NOW) 708mg Pumkin Seed Oil (660mg NOW, 48mg 5LX) 121mg Tumeric (66mg NOW, 55mg ZYF), helps with systemic inflammation including prostate 80mg Rosemary (75mg ZYF, 5mg 5LX), helps with systemic inflammation including prostate  These are only the major players of nutrition, IMO, for taking this combination for my prostate health (there are other ingredients as well). Without these supplements I believe I would be in trouble. I am very grateful to be alive today where these supplements are available to the general public to help with health.  TIP: I have found that the Zyflamend can give me a little heartburn from time to time taking it right before bedtime. I solve this two ways: either I take them 1 hour before bedtime or I eat 1/4 slice of a banana after taking the supplements. The banana seems to act as a soother and barrier to stomach acid reacting to any of the supplements. I do not eat more than 1/4 banana because I found out that bananas ""can"" be inflammatory so therefore eating too much of an inflammatory food just before bedtime could have a negative or counter active effect when your trying to reduce inflammation.  I hope this helps someone!",21

But I didn't noticed any major benefits from this supplement. This doesn't make this supplement bad, it's just that sometimes I don't notice effects from supplements since I already have a healthy diet.  This supplement didn't helped boost my immunity, nor at least slightly improve my seasonal allergies. I had minor flu symptoms at some point, didn't make a difference. I did felt my nails somewhat stronger and didn't get white spots while taking this supplement. No noticeable results for skin, maybe some small ones for eye health (my eyes seemed to become tired later in the day). The raw veggie mineral blend sounds very good on paper, I like it was added in; can't have enough trace minerals. The probiotics and enzyme mix didn't impacted my digestive system. I've took probiotics before and usually I can tell by my bowel movements when they work.  The capsules are easy to take. I can have them both with and without food in the morning, they don't upset my stomach or cause reflux.  Regarding packaging, I like that it comes in a glass bottle (not plastic). What I didn't liked is that the bottle seal under the cap was about un-peeled (or the glue loosed grip during storage / shipping). But the cap was sealed on top with a plastic foil. I don't know if this issue was caused by the brand or Amazon (since it was the direct seller).",26

ALSO...there are so many of us on Amazon trying to find products like supplements, vitamins, herbs,creams, etc., to manage our health and well being. I try hard to bring an honest review to you. However, much to my chagrin, I am finding paid for and planted reviews. We all know that the person selling a product is going to try and coax a couple of good reviews, but when I come across a product with an outstanding & unbelievable amount of 5 stars, I looks further. For what? Too many 5 star reviews from people who have no other reviews, written in as few words as possible to make the word quota. OR a 5 star review written by someone that has maybe 1 or 2 other reviews for a couple of cheap items, often all bought at the same time. Or many of these types of quick 5 star reviews showing up all around the same time period. Then there are the 'verified buyer' obvious paid reviews. I've read that this is worked by offering someone an Amazon gift card in exchange for that person purchasing the product then positively reviewing it, thus earning the 'verified buyer status' and elevating the validity of the review. So be forewarned and look a bit further in for the high quality reviews many of us take the time to write!

I was in search of a solution that would address the skin conditions I was having a few months after I stopped breast feeding and taking my prenatal pills (I wish I'd never stopped taking those pills 🤦🏿‍♀️). My breakouts were coming back to back. I'd get rid of one and another would follow, it was INFURIATING! Previously, my skincare routine incorporated an exfoliant, raw african black soap, and a balancing oil, but it was as if everything that was working for me before was useless at clearing my skin now. I even went to a dermatologist for a solution, which did nothing for me. Searching for natural skincare solutions for African American sensitive skin is....a task. To sum it up, after taking these Zinc supplements my skin appeared clearer within 2 days!! WHAT! I was shocked and amazed that it was as simple as incorporating Zinc in my diet to have my face back! Lol. I honestly haven't had any more breakouts since. I only take 1 every 2-3 days as a previous reviewer called out. Research also warns against adding too much Zinc to your diet so definitely keep that in mind. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend this product as a supplement to your skin care routine to alleviate breakouts. 👍🏿👌🏿",28

I haven't been entirely consistent with taking the supplements considering I often miss a couple days or more a week, but it hasn't made a difference because I'm still BV FREE!

I can't take synthetic thyroid hormone, it makes me sick as a dog, so was kind of limited in my choices. The blood test results were incredible. My TSH (which should be very low) had dropped by six points and my thyroid hormones, T-3 and T-4, were in the normal range for the first time since I've been wrestling with this problem. I didn't think I had been on the Thyroid Healing diet long enough to make a difference, and then, duh, remembered I had been taking zinc for a little over a month.

I do sometimes feel like I’m coming down with something but I seem to fight it off within a day, instead of getting full-blown sick. I take them with food because without, they upset my stomach. I've also noticed that I suddenly have a lot of hair regrowth around my face and my eyebrows are getting thicker. I had to look up if that could have to do with zinc deficiency and sure enough, zinc can help hair grow back. I wasn't expecting that, but it’s a perk.

Good news first. They’re nicely packaged and easy to swallow. I started with one per day. I had some hair loss. Figured it was ageing and don’t worry much. It really wasn’t much beyond what they say is normal. I’d just never shedded much so I noticed it. When I went to the recommended two per day I started losing hair at a more dramatic rate. After a couple of weeks or so it was tufts. As the story goes some people have an allergic reaction to zinc supplements. If you do, hair loss happens. How I wish I’d known this in advance. I’d have to say this particular supplement doesn’t absorb well. The reaction should have happened much sooner. I’m not knocking them over the hair loss anywhere near as much as the absorbency. Also, I really wish there was a warning on the bottle. It’s common enough that a simple search for hair loss helped me figure out the reason for my trouble. If you decide to try this, do two per day for a couple of weeks just to make sure. If you start losing hair then you know. I hope this saves someone else from the trouble I’ve had.  I hope this is helpful to someone. Thank you.",24

The pills are large, so I twist them open and sprinkle them over yogurt. Because of this, I know exactly how they smell and what they look like inside.  When I twisted these open, the powder was not off-white, dry, and loose powder. Rather, it was a beige color and a bit clumpy. There was also a slight odor. I didn't think much of it. However, after taking about 10 of these and twisting every one open, they were all like that. They also had a slightly off taste, so I knew something was off.  So... I purchased the same item at Target, and yes, the ones I bought here on amazon were spoiled. I threw them in the trash. I just looked at one-star reviews here and noticed a person said her bottle was fake and posted photos. Now I wish I had saved my bottle so I could compare.  I don't think amazon would ship fake products (other vendors may, but I trust amazon). I actually do recall the expiration on my spoiled jar was 8/25, the same as the lady who said her bottle was fake, so perhaps that was a bad batch(s).  Regardless, I know probiotics are very sensitive to temperature and how they are stored, and I think my product was spoiled (not a fake), which means I was taking useless pills.  I wanted to share this in case you have agut feeling your batch is off. Maybe you can see the powder inside is hard and is beige peeking through the capsule. The powder is typically white, not beige. Your bottle may also have an off smell. My husband noticed how differently the amazon bottle smelled vs the new Target bottle.  Perhaps amazon will read this and can look into this, review the batches and/or how they store this item.",18

I was so happy to find that this product has all of the strains typically lacking when you get BV, especially L. crispatus which is hard to find in a probiotic! And for an unbeatable price.

A healthy gut is essential to the proper functioning of many parts of the body, including the brain.  Does this work? I have used it for a few months; I don't know how to tell if it works. It is supposed to reduce gas. I'm waiting for that to happen. I will ask my GI physician once again in about a month.

I took my son's advice and was so impressed that I read a couple more of the doctor's books and those of many others as well.  Pelmutter is the Doctor behind this Garden of Life Probiotic. This best selling author is the only doctor in American who has the credentials of both a board certified neurologist and fellow of the American College of Nutrition.  I am glad I listened to both my son and Dr. Pelmutter's advice and learned about what gut flora, probiotics, and prebiotics are and why I needed this product.  This is the only product that I trust to help me keep my gut flora in balance. I have been taking this product for years and I feel so much better than I did before I started using them. There are a lot of products out there that make some wild claims, but I only believe this Doctor and this product.  I recommend that you read the aforementioned book and look at the ingredients of this product as compared to others.  This product works. My digestive system works much better since I started taking it.  My wife is a nurse and she was so impressed with how this product helped me that she started taking the Garden of Life Probiotic recommended for women.  I recommend this product without reservation to family, friends, and others who need to balance their gut bacteria. I also recommend that you read this product formulator's books. I am glad my son recommended Pelmutter's book, that I read it, that I understand the importance of balanced gut flora and that I began taking this product so many years ago.  Enjoy!",80

In summary, I totally recommend Garden of Life Probiotics! I think is a must-have supplement for men looking to prioritize their gut health and overall well-being.

I’ve been using it off and on for about 2 years now, but had previously purchased it from a local vitamin store. I had started taking this 2 years ago to help with constipation & slow digestion issues. At the time, I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms after stopping long term use of an herbal supplement called valerian. The withdrawal symptoms I had were high heart rate, anxiety, panic attacks, depression and insomnia. When I first started taking this probiotic, I noticed it helped me feel more calm & helped me sleep better. I researched online and found that probiotics help calm the nervous system and that’s definitely true with this probiotic. To help me with sleep, I find it helpful to take this with a glass of wine on an empty stomach in the evening before dinner. When I do that, I pretty much sleep straight through the night! Also I discovered it helps lower my high blood pressure. Normally I get white coat syndrome where my blood pressure goes up when I have a doctors appointment, even though I take blood pressure medicine. After using this probiotic, my blood pressure is lower & I have much more normal readings when I see my doctor. Also, one time at work I was already very busy & stressed out when I got some news that caused me to feel panicked and more stressed out and I started getting a headache. Luckily I had my bottle of this probiotic with me and took a pill. After about 1-2 hours, I started to feel more calm and my headache was alleviated! I’m so glad I found this probiotic and will continue to use it!",115

It has tons of CFUs... 50 billion! More is better, right? I recently took a test from Viome and discovered that my gut diversity level was in the bottom 5%. I realize its largely because I took these... flooding my gut with a ton of just a few types of bacteria. You need lots and lots of different types, but taking the same probiotic in massive amounts makes just a few strands dominate and causes problems... imbalance! Perhaps you may say its just a coincidence, but consider this... you typically have similar gut conditions to the people you live with. My wife just got her results... top 95% of diversity... the total opposite. She doesn't take a probiotic. Also, I have not taken any antibiotics in over 15 years, so that's not a factor.  I stopped taking this and switched to the custom probiotics that is made just for you by Viome. Far more expensive, but I've noticed results, quite dramatically. My anxiety is down significantly, despite massive work stress with my employee quitting and my boss getting fired and me having to cover all 3 positions.  I think these could be good for a limited period... 1-3 months, but based on what I know now, if you are not going to take a custom probiotic, then perhaps a rotation of totally different varieties that have lower CFU counts would be better. Also, spend time outside in the dirt and eat foods that help... probiotic and prebiotic foods.",54

I’m always looking for new things to help alleviate day to day issues - and so far Psyllium husk fiber and occasional prunes have been the best performers. I wanted to try a probiotic after reading lots of promising studies about them.  I did a ton of research on what strain, how much, etc. There’s a fair bit of studies out there if you are willing to do the reading. This GOL product had good coverage of most of the well studied probiotics - so on paper it looked very good.  I was a little annoyed by GOL’s marketing here in a few areas. The biggest one is they market this as “Men’s” and have a very similar one marketed as “Women’s”. There’s not reputable science behind these at this time - differentiating by sex with a 5% formula difference is totally marketing. I asked GOL specifically via email, giving them an opportunity to clarify why they did this - and I never received a response at all. I also didn’t like they didn’t list the CFUs per strain, just per category/parent. GOL was recently bought by Nestle, which was concerning too.  The product itself looked good. The packing was awesome - the shelf stable container they use is pretty neat tech. Never seen anything like it - the bottle interior has a liner that I assume absorbs moisture and regulates temperature.  But alas - it caused pretty bad pain for me. I tried it for 10 days, just to be sure, but I had to stop. Within the first dose, I was getting pretty bad gas and slight headaches. Bad bloating too. I thought it was stop overtime as my body got used to it - but it didn’t. On Day 10 it was still getting worse, and now my headaches were pretty bad and I wasn’t having good BMs at all.  So - it’s worth a try, but don’t let the rosy reviews on Amazon fool you. It may work wonders for you, or it may not. Probiotics, especially multiple strain, High CFU ones, are highly variable in user reaction.",26

Firstly, my toddler has just entered his picky stage and isn’t eating as much anymore, making it harder for him to potty or just not go as frequently. I wanted a good vitamin to help his gut but also keep him healthy considering how he’s surviving on water, rice, bananas and air. I wasn’t even considering this when buying these gummies, but He has eczema behind the knees and where his ear lobes connect to his head that won’t go away regardless of lotions or steroid creams. They’re so bothersome, he’s always scratching so hard that he leaves blood stains on his pillows and sheets because they’re so raw. I can’t lotion him because it burns so bad I mostly end up just using aquaphor to keep it from feeling chapped. Mind you, his eczema flares up when he eats dairy. We avoid it mostly but these problems areas just won’t go away no matter what. When he drinks milk, his forehead breaks out a bit and gets itchy but that’s about it. Just recently, his ears and behind the knees have started healing and have been less itchy. I’ve been able to use lotions in addition to the aquaphor and thought this is what was healing him but it doesn’t make sense because I’ve been doing this for FOREVER. Just this past week I let him drink a small cup of milk and he had no reaction, I let him have another 2 cups and still nothing. Then it clicked. THESE GUMMIES ARE HELPING HIS ECZEMA/reaction to dairy. I am SHOOK. A delicious GUMMY vitamin is doing this for my son. I myself don’t really take supplements, though I probably should just to maintain health but I don’t necessarily have any needs or concerns so I don’t. If anything I’ve done multi vitamins and prenatals. I wasn’t sure if this would really even do much but behold!! I will never not buy this vitamin from here on. I hope this helps other parents decide if this gummy is right for them as well! Also side note, I’ve only been giving him these for the past 2 weeks.",16

The only reason that I’m giving two stars is because there’s no artificial dye, all of the coloring is from actual fruit juice or vegetable juice. I was gonna give three stars, even with the sugar, the seed oil in the wax, but then I saw the cornstarch which is bioengineered. I will go back to the drops when they are $50 again. I guess I’ll have to go in person and try to find them somewhere. The infant drops were fantastic but I have a toddler now the price I paid for these they don’t need wax or seed oil or cornstarch a little bit of actual sugarcane is fine, but all the extra is unacceptable and unnecessary. Still a superior product compared to other chewables made by other companies. I guess I will have to switch over to HIYA at some point.",3

So I decided to ditch what I had been taking and doing and to try this and I am so HAPPY that I made that decision. I took one capsule yesterday morning and felt things starting to get better slowly.

I rejected using a laxative because Lyme disease can cause temporary paralysis of the digestive tract and I didn’t want to put myself in a worse situation so I researched and found probiotics can help. I chose Physician’s Choice 60 billion probiotic and I started feeling much better. After a couple of days everything was pretty much back to normal.

I looked at a bunch of different kinds within the brand, and settled on this one because it seemed to have fewer ingredients I didn’t want. I was pleasantly surprised to find out they actually taste like candy my kids liked when they were younger. Yes, they are gummy and stick together a bit, just like any other gummy product, but I had no problems getting them out of their container nor eating them, unlike some reviewers. I keep them in a cupboard in a spot where it’s always an average temp. You can chew these or just let them dissolve in your mouth, something I do most often. I take them one by one after a meal, letting them slowly melt as I do other things before brushing my teeth. The best thing? They actually work. You should definitely start small and slowly increase to what is prescribed to you. It makes the process easier and more pleasant. My digestion seems to be better, and I no longer have constipation, just normal, average, healthy stool. They are an expense at the amount my doctor has me on, but they’re worth every penny to not have the awful pain and nausea I had before I started taking them. Highly recommend.",5

I've tried other fiber supplements that were not as bad, so I assume that the inulin in these is just worse than the dextrin in others, at least for me.

This product lives up to its promise of promoting gentle, effective cleansing without any harsh side effects.  What I liked most is that it’s made with natural ingredients — no artificial fillers or stimulants, which is a huge plus for me. The formula includes things like cascara sagrada, aloe vera, and senna leaf, which are known to support digestion and regularity. Within just a couple of days, I noticed a big improvement in bloating and overall gut comfort.  The capsules are easy to take, and I didn’t experience any cramping or urgency, which I was a little worried about going in. Instead, it worked gradually and smoothly, which makes it perfect for people with sensitive systems.  One thing to note: it's important to drink plenty of water and eat light while using this, as it can be quite effective. Also, it’s best used as a short-term detox or to reset your digestive system — not something to rely on every day.  Overall, I’d definitely recommend NB Pure’s Natural Colon Cleanse and Detox to anyone looking for a clean, plant-based way to support gut health, especially if you're starting a new wellness routine or just need a reset.",31

I'm not cramping for hours or feeling like I have to go to the bathroom for hours. If I don't feel it first thing, I will drink a large glass of water and then I'm done.  This is honestly the absolute hands down best thing I've ever taken for constipation and I am never without some. Matter of fact, I just went on vacation and forgot to take it. I ordered an Instacart delivery from a nearby Vitamin Shoppe and the delivered same day to the front desk. I knew I needed this because when I'm on vacation, I'm eating a lot of different things that I usually don't eat at home.

The end of last year I was doing some heavy duty studying so I was drinking lots of coffee, caffeine energy drinks, diet sodas, taking Excedrin almost every day, etc. My eating was atrocious...lots of fast foods, processed foods, and sugary sweets and to top it off I was barely drinking any water. This went on for about 3 months.  When I decided to start eating healthy & lose some weight, although I rehydrated myself (drinking at least a gallon of water a day), I still wasn't losing the weight I should have, my stomach was constantly bloated, & I was barely going to the bathroom. I tried metamucil bars which worked a little, then I tried psyllium husks which also worked a little. I tried senna capsules & that barely worked, even an enema barely produced results. At first I thought ""maybe I'm not backed up"" but I wasn't going hardly at all...I would get the urge but then...nothing.  I then began taking 3 Mag 07 in the evening & let me tell you...things are REALLY moving now! Not just water either like before! This is a stool softener so don't expect your stool to come out formed, but this worked when NOTHING else did. I'm going to keep taking 3-4 every evening for the next 5-7 days as recommended on the bottle as a cleanse. HIGHLY recommend this...no cramping & very predictable. I've been taking it at 11pm & by 4 or 5am I have to go.  UPDATE- MARCH 17, 2012: After taking 3-4 each night for 7 days and then 1 or 2 for seven days, don't want to gross anyone out but my stool went from very dark (the color of strong coffee)for several days & finally it got to where I could see through it. I'm happy to say I'm now all cleaned out & REGULAR. I only take a couple on occasion now. I've also lost about 15 lbs. since with diet & exercise of course, but my weight loss is steady now unlike before.",628

I’d recommend it to anyone whether for daily maintenance or for those like me who sometimes deal with issues where it’s literally been like a week of no movement…it’s literally saved me from having to resort to painful alternatives that don’t work or the worst case hospital visit. Seriously the first time I tried it I was desperate…it had literally been weeks and I was looking at an enema or worst case an ER visit and my mom recommended these. I went for the full cleanse mode and took 5 before bed making sure it was at least two hours after I ate and drank a bunch of water as instructed. The next day I had a little movement but was disappointed and worried it wasn’t working…but that was just the beginning…a couple hours later I was back in the bathroom and let’s just say it worked almost terrifyingly well…and no pain or discomfort! The reviews don’t lie: it was just that “yep, I’ve gotta go” feeling and the flood gates opened. No pain, no bloating, no cramping…just relief. I may have been sweating and a little out of breath after and I definitely paid more than one visit to the restroom that day so I’d definitely recommend using it on a weekend when you plan to be at home but seriously; it worked so well it was almost disturbing how well it worked. But that’s the key. It works! Truly, try it. It’s a staple for me now and I’ll never let myself be without it. Whether you need the full cleanse or just help with getting regular it helps. Don’t think; just try it!",44

I have tried metamucil, pill supliments and even raw psyllium husk but could not reach a 'regular' level of control. I took the Mag07 three pill regime which, as advertised, is a total purge and was an over correction. After a few weeks of experimenting i settled on one pill in the morning and one in the evening. Very effective and easy BMs, with one caveat - the moment you feel the urge, which is more subtle than those during pre-Mag07, you need act. And the timing is not consistent depending upon your eating habits. You gotta go when you gotta go.  I have not been constipated in six months.",18

But I began to fee nausea ...Which is not one of my migraine symptoms.  I made it to the restroom and threw up , I had the worst stomach pains, I had the nastiest heartburn and worst ...I still hadn't POOPED..... fast forward to around 1 am ....I had the worst EXPLOSIVE diarrhea ...you know the kind you only see at the public stalls that no one wants to use ....  for the sake of my dignity I wont go into details .

First, I will try to spare the disgusting details. It is clear that my digestive system does not work properly. The doctor told me I need to eat more fiber, however, that didn't make sense as I am a vegetarian and with a diet rich in fruits and vegetables my fiber intake is pretty high. My body has been holding on to waste so long, I experience stomach pain and nausea every time I eat food. I am not sure if there is a connection but I was also having regular headaches, trouble sleeping, rapid weight gain and a face prone to more breakouts than in the past. Other reviews suggest they saw results the next day and did not need to take 5 pills, so I started with three pills at night and I drank plenty of water. I did feel the tummy rumblings but the next day, I did not see results and I was discouraged. My second evening, I went ahead and took five and drank lots of water. I saw results on the third day, not a massive elimination event, like others have experienced, but it did work and I hadn't been able to go for at least a week before I ordered these. I have been maintaining a constant 3 pills since I'd started and continue to have regular movements (multiple a day). Since I started 5 days ago, I have lost nearly 5 pounds (my assumption is that is how much waste my body was carrying) and that number continues to drop, I haven't had any stomach pains when I eat and my acne is clearing up. This has been a life saver for me and worth the expense. I feel so much better. I hope this review encourages anyone that is questioning whether to purchase this. I highly recommend!",1

According to Amazon, I have purchased this 56 times, so that should tell you something. No joke I have taken this every single day since 2016 and it works great for keeping you regular. I have tried everything and nothing else worked for me, not even extreme measures like colonics. It's advertised as a ""cleanse"", but you can safely take it in adjustable doses on a daily basis. I even brought the bottle with me to my doctor's office and she approved it for daily usage. You can play with the dosage to see what works for you. When you first start taking it you might want to be at home so you are close to the toilet, just in case. Your custom dose might take some adjustment.  I take this product at night with a large glass of water. Within about 15-20 minutes it makes me very sleepy. I've heard that magnesium does this, so this is just an added benefit for me.  For a year or so I tried using a much cheaper generic brand and found I had to take about 30% more in order to get the same impact, so I switched back. I'm a lifer!!!",40
