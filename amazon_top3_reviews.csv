2025-09-23,Amazon,"Garden of Life Once Daily Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Women 50 Billion CFU 16 Probiotic Strains with Organic Prebiotics for Digestive, Vaginal & Immune Health, Dairy Free, Shelf Stable 30 Capsules",B00Y8MP4G6,5.0,"I am impressed with these probiotics. Despite their larger size, they are easy to swallow and work wonderfully for gut health, keeping my bowels regular with every dose. I've purchased multiple bottles of Dr. Formulated Probiotics and confidently recommend them to many of my patients. The price is quite reasonable for the quality provided. I do not have any side effects from them, and I am very sensitive to a lot of things.  In terms of immune health, I rarely get sick, which I attribute, at least in part, to the effectiveness of these probiotics. For vaginal health, I have experienced no issues whatsoever, indicating that they are doing their job. Additionally, I love that this product doesn’t require refrigeration, making it incredibly convenient. The bottle is also sealed with a tamper-proof seal, and the expiration date typically extends for over a year, ensuring freshness. Overall, I recommend these probiotics.",23

2025-09-23,Amazon,"Garden of Life Once Daily Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Women 50 Billion CFU 16 Probiotic Strains with Organic Prebiotics for Digestive, Vaginal & Immune Health, Dairy Free, Shelf Stable 30 Capsules",B00Y8MP4G6,5.0,"It does exactly what it says. I researched what, when, where, how, why, and if I should I take Probiotics. I found that the minimum requirements for effectiveness is 50 billion and a minimum of 11 strains. A lot of products claim to meet those two guidelines. But when you look at the ingredients they have a list of stuff that has nothing to do do with Probiotics bottom line. A lot of scams out there with products claiming to be the real thing but they are full of herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients that are known only to them. If you want all those ingredients buy over the counter vitamins, which might be a lot cheaper. But you and me are looking at Probiotics for a reason. Remember to stay focused on that particular reason.  I carefully compiled a list of over 125 products. Some had a few details on the ingredients and some had none. Yet, they all claimed to be Probiotics, which I quickly found out that it was not true. Anyway, if a particular product did not clearly list the required ingredients, I crossed it out from the list. Every product claims to be the best on the market. Don't fall for it. One product at the time was scratched from the list, until I found the right one for me and my medical issues.  I decided to buy Garden if Life Probiotic. I made this choice after pouring many hours on research, which needed to meet specific criteria: 50 billion and 16 strains. Anything less than 50 billion isn't that effective for reaching my medical goals (see them listed somewhere else in this post). And of course, every ingredient that is contained in this product is clearly listed on the Amazon website. My doctor said that there was a lot of research on Probiotic products on neuroscience journals and how Probiotics could help me with my particular medical conditions, which the medical field had nothing else to to offer me. As a professional researcher, I had to get my hands, right away, on high quality journals on line. I read more than 15 articles from different journals. It took me a long time (over 2 weeks) because my cognitive difficulties (remembering, understanding, etc.). The research was well designed, the findings were consistent and they were well supported. If you feel the urgency to read research just go to Google and search for ""Probiotics research on neuroscience journals."" From there you get to pick and choose from a huge selection of journals. It's like a huge salad bar, with enough variety to satisfy anyone with an enormous hunger for information. It just doesn't get any better than that.  Note: Insurance companies do not cover this product. It really is a disappointment but not enough to discourage me give up on my search for a light at the end of the tunnel.  Next is affordability. Since my goal is to consistently take it every day for many years to come, I needed to to make sure it was affordable. This product is a winner!!! Since I'm on a fixed income, I need to make sure that I wouldn't go broke in the process of trying to reconnect with my cognitive abilities and, maybe even restore some of my memories. If nothing else, based on the research, I truly believe that I'll be able to improve my cognitive skills and keep new memories. And that, ladies and gentlemen, IS THE BOTTOM LINE. The simple FACT is that I have been taking this product for just a few days and I can SEE SOME ENCOURAGING RESULTS. I wrote this post (a) without any hand written notes on the side to rely on, (b) without taking me for ever, and (c) without sweeting bullets connected with the frustration of not having a clue whether I was making any sense. Let me give you an example of how I feel right now. This is, indeed, like you are watching the Super Bowl game and your team is getting its asses kicked, badly (my doctors lack of resources to help me). You almost lose hope (will I loose my mind completely? how soon? What will happen to me when I can no longer think nor remember simple words or conversations with my loved ones?), but you don't give up. You heart is full of faith thinking that something can be done to win the game. As hard as it is, and with very little hope someone makes the perfect play (my doctor studying Probiotics for years and recently recommending to patients who had similar problems like mine. According to my doctor he was getting encouraging results) and you come back from the brinck of despair. The last day of the season, on the last second you find yourself being a part of of the winning team. You feel like you were present in the stadium with your team players when you won the Super Bowl (my the help of Probiotics). And you feel like life is returning to you and your steps are lighter, quicker, easier, and you have all the confidence of the world. Life seems to be returning to your mind and the future looks full of new possibilities and new adventures. I CAN THINK, ENGAGE IN SIMPLE CONVERSATIONS WITHOUT GETTING LOST, AND THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING. I have faith that I am going to to have a great future. A future without fear. Please you all wish me good luck, and if you don't mind praying for a stranger pray that my new found hope on Probiotics really works. Thank you for reading this long, mushy, and even corney post, but I am too excited. I just couldn't wait to share with the world. I hope others too can find new hope with this product. Nothing is guaranteed in this life. Not even Probiotics. It is just my own experience and nothing else. P. S. I'm not being paid for my comments nor was asked to write this post.",11
2025-09-23,Amazon,"Garden of Life Once Daily Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Women 50 Billion CFU 16 Probiotic Strains with Organic Prebiotics for Digestive, Vaginal & Immune Health, Dairy Free, Shelf Stable 30 Capsules",B00Y8MP4G6,4.0,"I started taking this once-daily probiotic a few months ago, mainly to support digestion and general wellness. I wasn’t entirely consistent at first—there were weeks I skipped—but I recently finished the bottle and figured it was a good time to share my thoughts. What I liked right away was how convenient it is. The capsules are shelf-stable, dairy-free, and don’t need to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to include in my morning routine. After about a week of consistent use, I started noticing a positive change—my digestion felt more regular and less bloated overall. Most importantly, it helped establish a more consistent bathroom schedule, which was a big win for me.  One thing I wanted to mention: before buying, I saw some reviews mentioning mild bloating or gas during the adjustment period. I didn’t experience that initially, but after a few weeks I did notice that drinking milk sometimes caused a bit of odd intestinal movement—like a noticeable rumbling or gurgling. It wasn’t painful or uncomfortable enough to be a problem, and I never had diarrhea, but it was new for me. After looking into it, it seems changes in gut flora can affect how your body reacts to foods you’re used to. Nothing serious, just something worth knowing if you experience a similar shift.",2

2025-09-23,Amazon,"Garden of Life Once Daily Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Women 50 Billion CFU 16 Probiotic Strains with Organic Prebiotics for Digestive, Vaginal & Immune Health, Dairy Free, Shelf Stable 30 Capsules",B00Y8MP4G6,5.0,"I’ve been using the Garden of Life Once Daily Probiotics for Women for about five months now, and I can honestly say it’s made a real difference. I originally picked it because it has multiple strains, especially Lactobacillus reuteri, which I was already familiar with from my homemade yogurt (I ferment it for 36 hours). This supplement felt like the perfect way to add extra support.  What surprised me is how much it’s helped with things I didn’t even expect—like PMS symptoms and joint pain. My monthly cramps and mood swings have calmed down a lot, and my joints feel less stiff and achy, even after workouts or long days. I’ve also noticed I sleep better and recover faster after exercise, which I was really hoping for with L. reuteri.  For vaginal support, this probiotic includes good strains like Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. reuteri, and L. acidophilus that help balance things out and prevent infections. The organic prebiotics in it also help the good bacteria grow. Since I started taking it, I haven’t had any problems with odor, discharge, or infections. I know everyone’s different and some might prefer other strains like L. crispatus or L. jensenii, but this probiotic has been reliable for me. It’s definitely worth trying if you want something that actually helps—just listen to how your body feels.  On top of that, I try to eat foods that support vaginal health, like yogurt, and other fermented foods for probiotics, plus prebiotic-rich foods like garlic, onions, and bananas to feed the good bacteria. Healthy fats from avocados, nuts, and seeds, along with plenty of veggies and fruits, also help keep things balanced.  It’s super convenient too—no need to refrigerate, and it’s dairy-free, which is great for me. Overall, this isn’t just a trendy health product that sounds good; it’s simple, clean, and really works. If you want support for digestion, immune health, vaginal health, and overall balance, this is definitely worth a try.",101

I recently purchased Nature's Bounty Fish Oil for a few weeks now and I'm genuinely impressed. The softgels are easy to swallow, and best of all — no fishy aftertaste or burps like I’ve experienced with other brands. I appreciate that each serving packs a solid amount of Omega-3s to support heart health, and the 200-count bottle is a great value for the price.  I feel more energetic overall, and I like knowing I'm doing something good for my cardiovascular health. Plus, it's a trusted brand with consistent quality.

The softgels are smooth and easy to swallow despite their larger size, and I’ve noticed no aftertaste or fishy burps, which is often an issue with other brands. Each serving packs a good balance of EPA and DHA, and at 1200 mg per softgel, it feels like I’m getting solid heart-health support without having to take a handful of pills.  What I like most is the value: 200 softgels in a single bottle is generous, and taken daily, it lasts quite a while. The quality feels reliable, and I appreciate that Nature’s Bounty is a brand I’ve trusted for other vitamins too.  If I had to point out something to keep in mind, it’s that the capsules are on the larger side, so if you have trouble with swallowing pills, you might need to take them with a full glass of water.  Bottom line: A dependable, high-quality fish oil supplement that delivers omega-3s in an easy-to-take, value-packed form—great for anyone looking to support heart health with confidence.",4

The gut is connected to the brain. Recent research has shown that a healthy gut leads to a healthy brain and a good night's sleep. Probiotics are essential for a healthy day. Also, taking them stimulates bowel movements. Constipation disappears, and you find yourself going to the bathroom at regular intervals. This improves your quality of life. By flushing out old waste, you can replenish your energy with a fresh new level. It's a vital cycle for health. It's a bit pricey, but the quality is so good I couldn't resist. There are plenty of cheaper options out there, though. I wish this one was a bit more affordable. The medicine bottle looks too big for the number of capsules inside. Please fill it up.

I was skeptical at first, but they debloated my tummy so quick. I used to not be able to wear ANYTHING remotely tight fitting on my stomach, because as soon as I ate anything I would bloat and have my stomach cut into. No jeans, no tights, no waist bands. Now I can wear whatever I want and won't be doubled over in pain, it is really a relief.",0

Been taking itnfor a little over a year now. It has helped with getting things moving as well as regulating my menstrual. I only started taking prebiotics because my GYN suggested it after an ovarian cyst rupture. Haven't had any since. Please note: Doc did not recommend this brand, I did my own extensive research and went with this brand. I like that they are light and extremely easy to swallow however, I prefer to empty the contents over swallowing the pill. With that said, the first 3/4 of my last bottle was good but the last 15ish pills were all clumped up when I tried to empty the contents. This leads me to wonder if all the pills I didnt empty were clumped and not in its powdery form and why are they clumped..AND does itnhave the same affect clumped and hard opposed to powder. Overall I like the product but dont like the clumps.",40
